BACKTEST
- fix private functions to accept $@ and not use $__args 
- add version folder to store backtests 
- add tmp backtest folder (and use the normal for only official tests)
- limit number of strategy to 3 (no reason to test more of them at every version)

REPORT
- fix problem with report to official folder 
- add plotting 
- filter information to important ones 

NEW version
- add possibility to run new opt with different suffix (this will allow us to optimize up to 2000 iterations one strategy and add the version.json + official backtest )

TAG
- add command to tag 
- shall i push all official test results (only json) or report (either one of the two, no reason to push both). S
- So far I am oriented to backtest results since i want to cap the amount of strategies to 3

LESS IMPORTANT 
- readme 
- optimized.json move to /version/suffix/timeframe so i can create a run function and given --suffix --timeframe --version it will load directly the .json optimized. 
  It is not better or worse, just more intuitive given the format of ./ycc 

OPTIONAL
- mongodb integration? maybe not needed but definitely cool idea
